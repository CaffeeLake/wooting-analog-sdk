# Wooting Analog SDK

This repo contains all the core cross-platform components of the Wooting Analog SDK. The SDK and most of the components are built on Rust and should run on Windows, Mac and Linux, following the same steps for each platform unless otherwise specified.

NOTE: Use the `WOOTING_ANALOG_SDK_PLUGINS_PATH` environment variable to tell the SDK where to search for plugins.

Have a look at the [SDK usage](SDK_USAGE.md) for a guide on how to use the SDK and the [Plugin introduction](PLUGINS.md) for information on creating plugins.

## Components
* `wooting-analog-sdk`: The core Analog SDK which handles loading of plugins. This is installed systemwide and is updated separately
* `wooting-analog-common`: This library contains all common Analog SDK definitions which are used by every part
* `wooting-analog-plugin-dev`: This library contains all common elements needed for designing plugins. This re-exports `wooting-analog-common`, so it is not required for plugins to separately depend on `wooting-analog-common`
* `wooting-analog-wrapper`: This is the SDK wrapper which is what Applications should use to communicate with the SDK. The linked dll should be shipped with the application using it.
* `wooting-analog-test`: This is a C# test application which can be used to test the SDK through the wrapper.
* `wooting-analog-test-plugin`: Dummy plugin which uses shared memory so other processes can control the output of the plugin. This is used for unit testing of the SDK and allows the `wooting-analog-virtual-kb` to work
* `wooting-analog-virtual-kb`: Virtual Keyboard using GTK which allows to set the analog value of all the keys through the dummy plugin. This allows you to test an Analog SDK implementation without an analog device

## Building 
### Build Dependencies
* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make)
* [cbindgen](https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen) (Should be installed automatically if necessary)
* [dotnet-core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) If you want to use `wooting-analog-test`
* [libgtk-3](https://gtk-rs.org/docs-src/requirements.html) If you want to build the `wooting-analog-virtual-kb`, follow the install instructions from [here](https://gtk-rs.org/docs-src/requirements.html) (for Windows MSVC I also had to add `%VCPKGDIR%\lib` to the `LIB` environment variable)


### How to Build
Everything can be built using this command. All the outputs will be under `target/debug`
```
cargo make
```

The current build process is setup to verify the existing generated headers in the test phase. If you decide to make changes which effect these outputs, you can update the headers by running:
```
cargo make gen-headers
```


To run the test application:
```
cargo make test-app
```

To run the virtual keyboard (The Analog SDK must be running for this to work):
```
cargo make virtual-kb
```

### Outputs
All build outputs can be found under `target/debug`, with generated headers coming under the `includes` and `includes-cpp` directories.

Currently the headers have to be manually generated and kept in the repo. When intentional changes are made, the testing phase verifies that the pre-generated headers match what would be generated now to ensure that accidental changes aren't made to the output of the header generation.

### Headers
* `wooting-analog-wrapper.h`: This is the header which includes everything that you need to use the SDK. (This uses `wooting-analog-common.h` which defines all relevant enums & structs)
* `wooting-analog-common.h`: This defines all common enums, headers & structs which are needed by plugins & SDK users
* `wooting-analog-plugin-dev.h`: This includes `wooting-analog-common.h` & additional functions which are obtained from statically linking to the analog-sdk-common library. (FOR USE WITH PLUGINS)
* `plugin.h`: This is the header which plugins should use to define all functions that need to be exported for a plugin to work
